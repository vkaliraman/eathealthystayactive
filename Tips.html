		    <div class="tipitems">Organize your kitchen. Keep frequently used items such as cooking oils/sprays, spatulas, cutting boards, and spices within easy reach. This will save you from having to search for them later</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Clear the clutter. Before you start cooking, clear off your counters. This allows more room for prep space</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Chop extra. When chopping up veggies for a meal, chop more than you need. Take the extra, place in a reusable container and freeze. Then next time you need it, you can skip a step</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Have everything in place. Grab all ingredients needed for your meal – vegetables chopped, spices measured, and meats thawed. It will be easier to spot missing items and avoid skipping steps</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Double your recipe. For your next casserole or stew, try doubling the recipe and freezing the extra. You’ll save time and make cooking next week’s dinner a snap</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Clean as you go. Fill up the sink with soapy water and wash the dishes as you cook. It’ll make clean up go much smoother</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Save some for later. Freeze leftover soups, sauces, or gravies in small reusable containers</div>

		    <div class="tipitems">Order a fruit salad instead of fries</div>

				<div class="tipitems"><strong>DEVELOP HEALTHY EATING HABITS WITH YOUR CHILD: SET A GOOD EXAMPLE</strong></div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Eat meals with your child whenever possible. Let your child see you enjoying fruits, vegetables, and whole grains at meals and snacks</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Show your child how to make healthy choices when you are on the run. Put oranges, bananas, or other fruits in your bag for quick snacks. Let your child see that you like to munch on vegetables when you're on the go</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Encourage your preschooler to help you prepare meals and snacks. Teach your child to tear lettuce or add veggie toppings to pizza</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Share the adventure. Be willing to try new foods together</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Keep things positive. Discourage older children and other family members from making yucky faces or negative comments about unfamiliar foods</div>
		    <div class="tipitems">Set a good example for physical activity, too. Make play time a family time. Walk, run, and play with your child rather than sitting on the sidelines</div>
